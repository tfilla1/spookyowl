        <p>Hola, here are some games.</p>
        <p>There's 'baseball', which is pretty fun, just start clicking.</p>
        <p>
          Also, there's hopper and cube, which are pretty close to the same, but
          are pretty fun, and will get worked on eventually. Just press spacebar
          and other buttons, hope for the best, expect the worst
        </p>
        <p>stay foolish, stay beautiful, you are you after all.</p>
